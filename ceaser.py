# The Caesar cipher is an ancient encryption algorithm used by Julius Caesar. It 
# encrypts letters by shifting them over by a 
# certain number of places in the alphabet. We 
# call the length of shift the key. For example, if the 
# key is 3, then A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes 
# F, and so on. To decrypt the message, you must shift 
# the encrypted letters in the opposite direction. This 
# program lets the user encrypt and decrypt messages 
# according to this algorithm.

# When you run the code, the output will look like this:

# Do you want to (e)ncrypt or (d)ecrypt?
# > e
# Please enter the key (0 to 25) to use.
# > 4
# Enter the message to encrypt.
# > Meet me by the rose bushes tonight.
# QIIX QI FC XLI VSWI FYWLIW XSRMKLX.


# Do you want to (e)ncrypt or (d)ecrypt?
# > d
# Please enter the key (0 to 26) to use.
# > 4
# Enter the message to decrypt.
# > QIIX QI FC XLI VSWI FYWLIW XSRMKLX.
# MEET ME BY THE ROSE BUSHES TONIGHT.
